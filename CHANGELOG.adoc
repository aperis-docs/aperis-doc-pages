= CHANGELOG

== 1.0.0-pre5

Fixed an issue where sidebar would unexpectedly be closed
on outside click on wide viewports.

== 1.0.0-pre4

Documentation pages now feature expandable sidebar with navigation.

Sidebar is open by default on wide viewports.

If JS is not present, behavior is as before: navigation is always present
after content.
